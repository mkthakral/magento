<p>As a service provider, FOLYOZ does not negotiate on behalf of Artists. If you're not familiar with negotiating prices or contracts, there's some useful information in your Help Wiki. (We would love to see this Wiki grow into a community library,&nbsp;If you can contribute your knowledge to the Help Wiki, please let us know from the form above).</p>
<p>FOLYOZ only reports the actions taken by Art Directors in your Analytics page, these reports are a good indicator of how Art Directors are reacting to your work, and not vanity metrics from other Artists looking at your work.</p>
<p>FOLYOZ does not provide watermarks or overlays to prevent image theft because no software can prevent screen captures, but there's strong words of caution and infringement actions you can take in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.folyoz.com/copyright" target="_blank">Copyright</a>.</p>
